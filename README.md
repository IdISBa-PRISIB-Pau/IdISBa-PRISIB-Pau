- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pau PericÃ s (@IdISBa-PRISIB-Pau) from the [Health Data Research Platform](http://www.idisba.es/en/Support-Services/Scientific-Technical-Platforms/Research-in-Health-Information) of the [Health Research Institute of the Balearic Islands](http://www.idisba.es/en/)
- Our platform provides data from EHR to different health research groups ensuring the compliance with all ethics and legal regulations
- Iâ€™m interested in developing tools for health data analysis in the context of federated research 
- We are collaborating with [EHDEN](https://ehden.eu/), [OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/), [Impact-Data](https://impact-data.bsc.es/) and [EOSC](https://eosc.eu/) with the goal of making the secondary use of health data for research trustworthy, eficient, repeatable, reproducible, replicable and reliable
